# Wolf4VS2015
A quick 'n' dirty port of Wolf4SDL to Visual Studio 2015. Tried to make everything work in one repo, and tried to clean it. Since I removed the MAME OPL part, it's also GPL compliant!

# Wolf4SDL
Wolf4SDL is an open-source port of id Software's classic first-person shooter Wolfenstein 3D to the cross-platform multimedia library "Simple DirectMedia Layer (SDL)" (http://www.libsdl.org). It is meant to keep the original feel while taking advantage of some improvements mentioned in the list below.
